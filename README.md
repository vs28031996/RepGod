 A simple application that uses steganography library to encode and decode messages. 
 The user begins with a option to register or work with old credentials,
 then is presented with a menu to perform operation such as set status , 
 update status , read messages , send messages , read old chat history, etc. 
 Also there is a special function that reads all the messages and check for special words like "help me " or something of the kind. 
 The application doesn't implement file handling , so you have to start from the starting everytime .
 however for the convenience some data has been pre-loaded you can work with that.
